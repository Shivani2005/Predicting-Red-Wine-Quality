# Predicting-Red-Wine-Quality\
Red wine is a type of wine which is manufactured using dark-colored grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can be ranging from violet to brick to brown. This quality and taste of wines comes from its ingredients besides grapes. These include potassium sorbate, calcium carbonate, sulfur dioxide, sugar, and various flavors. 
Red wine has a quality index which is dependent upon its contents, which are analyzed in the following sections.
The aim of this project is to predict the quality of red wine sample on the basis of its constituents which includes chlorides, sulfates, residual sugar, alcohol, citic acid, sulfur dioxide, pH, and density levels of the sample.
Three machine learning algorithms have been applied to check which provides the most accurate model. The algorithms are KNN, Guassian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier. Among these Naive Bayes trained a very accurate model followed by random forest classifier and then KNN.
